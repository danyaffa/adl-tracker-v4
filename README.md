### âœ… Ready for Upload:
You can now safely replace the old `README.md` file with this one. Let me know if you'd like it saved and sent as `.md` or `.txt`.

Would you like me to also:
- [ ] Rebuild the `.env.example` file?
- [ ] Help clean the `.git` history to erase secrets permanently?

Standing by.
